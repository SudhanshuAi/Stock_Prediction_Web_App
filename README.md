# Stock Prediction System Application

## Introduction
Predicting stock prices is a challenging task due to the lack of specific patterns. Stock prices are influenced by supply and demand dynamics over time. Machine learning algorithms, particularly **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks, can help identify patterns in stock price data. LSTM is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that excels at remembering information over long periods, making it ideal for time series forecasting like stock price prediction. RNNs process data step-by-step, maintaining an internal state that summarizes previously seen data, which is crucial for accurate predictions.

The successful prediction of stock prices can lead to significant financial gains, making this a valuable tool for investors and traders.


## Project Scope
This project is designed to be a generic solution applicable to any business or individual interested in stock price prediction. It provides users with a user-friendly interface to input stock data and receive predictions. Additionally, the application offers summarized data and insights to assist users in making informed decisions.

## Project Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the Stock Prediction System Application on your local machine.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Change the directory to where you want to clone the repository and run:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Stock-Prediction-System-Application.git
cd Stock-Prediction-System-Application

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

**For Windows:**
    
    ```bash
    
    python -m venv virtualenv
    
-   **For macOS and Linux:**
    
    python3 -m venv virtualenv
    

### Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies.

-   **For Windows:**
    
    virtualenv\Scripts\activate
    
-   **For macOS and Linux:**
    
    source virtualenv/bin/activate
    

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using the  `requirements.txt`  file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Step 5: Migrate the Django Project

Apply the database migrations to set up the database schema.

-   **For Windows:**
    
    python manage.py migrate
    
-   **For macOS and Linux:**
    
    python3 manage.py migrate
    

### Step 6: Run the Application

Start the Django development server to run the application.

-   **For Windows:**
    
    python manage.py runserver
    
-   **For macOS and Linux:**
    
    python3 manage.py runserver
    

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to  `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`  to access the application.
